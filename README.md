 ## INTRODUCTION 
 
The project is centered around the design and development of a Personalized Academic Planner (PAP). Which developed with the intent to help students become more effective at managing their time, reduce stress from their course load, and develop better study habits that will help them get better grades.  
The rationale behind this project comes from the increasing demands and challenges students face when managing their academic responsibilities. The PAP's goal is to give students a customized planner that fits their individual needs by letting them alter it according to their courses, due dates, and study styles. It is anticipated that this personalized approach will improve students' motivation, engagement, and general academic achievement.  
In the following sections contained within this project would be disscussed below.
