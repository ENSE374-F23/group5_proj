 ## INTRODUCTION 
 
The project is centered around the design and development of a Personalized Academic Planner (PAP). Which developed with the intent to help students become more effective at managing their time, reduce stress from their course load, and develop better study habits that will help them get better grades.  
The rationale behind this project comes from the increasing demands and challenges students face when managing their academic responsibilities. The PAP's goal is to give students a customized planner that fits their individual needs by letting them alter it according to their courses, due dates, and study styles. It is anticipated that this personalized approach will improve students' motivation, engagement, and general academic achievement.  
The Design problem, requirements, the various solutions we came up with and the limitations associated with the PAP will be discussed below.

## Problem Definition  

The problem that the PAP aims to solve are the difficulties students often face when managing their academic tasks and schedules.

## Design Requirements

Design requirements Included functions objectives and constraints all of which were satisfied in this project. As stated in the 
[Project Requirements Document](https://github.com/ENSE374-F23/group5_proj/blob/main/Documents/Project_Requirements_Document.docx)

## Solutions
Hi-Fidelity Prototype -- Figma

#### First Solution
This solution is the first iteration for our PAP it has a login/ logout module and main page for adding task. We did not choose this module because its design was not able to provide us with all the required functionalities like the course management feature that was needed for our application.

#### Final Solution
This is the final solution. This solution is better than our previous solutions because it encompasses all the desired functionalities and components that is needed in our application.

#### Components 

The components of our final design are:

- User interface component: This is the front-end component that users interact with. It’s designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, providing features like task input, calendar view.
- Database: This component stores all the user data including their tasks, deadlines and more.
- Authentication System: This component manages user accounts, including registration, login, and password management.
- Server: This is the back-end component that processes user requests, interacts with the database, and sends responses back to the UI.
- Notification System: This component sends reminders to users about their upcoming tasks and deadlines.

#### Features
- Login and register feature
- Course Management feature
- Personal dashboard feature
- Exam schedule
- Assignment tracker

####  Environmental, Societal, Safety, and Economic Considerations

- Environmantal: Our final design of the PAP contributes positively to the environment as it reduces the need for physical planners, thereby saving paper and reducing waste.
- Societal: Our final solution was designed to be accessible and inclusive, catering to a diverse range of users.
- Saftey: To ensure user data protection our desgin would provide user with login and sign up module and salting/ Hashing of passwords
- Economic Considerations: Our final design was implemented to be ocst effective using less lines of code to achieve a better level of functionality than our previous design.

#### Limitations

- Internet Dependency: Since the (PAP) is a web application users without a proper internet connection would not have access to the (PAP).
- Customization Limitations: Users would be limited to how they can customize thier experince on the PAP
- Accessibility: The PAP may not be fully accessible to users with disabilities unless specific accessibility features have been implemented.
